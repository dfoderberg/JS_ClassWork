/**
 * @file
 * This assignment has you simplify an object.  You need to get really good
 * at composing simple objects into human-readable formats, and you need to
 * likewise break those human-readable objects apart into simple parts so they
 * can be edited.
 * 
 * To complete this assignment, examine the books structure in books.json.
 * 
 * You'll be benefitted to test your function using the "getFirstTenBooks"
 * function.  It's recommended to leverage a combination of console.log's
 * and the debugger to see what's going on where.
